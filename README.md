# Run me!

In solution, open Instructions.txt and enter the instructions for the robot, one instruction per row.

The following types of instructions are accepted:

PLACE 0,0,[Direction] //Be sure to get the commas in the correct order. Directions are NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST.

MOVE

RIGHT

LEFT

REPORT


Whitespace such as tabs and newlines will be ignored by the instruction parser.
Lines starting with // are comments and will be ignored by the instruction parser as well.

Remember to save Instructions.txt after making changes, otherwise they will not take place.

Run the project to try out your instructions.

# Test data

If you're not feeling creative at the moment there is some prepared test data in the solution, in file TestData.txt.
Copy+paste the instructions you want to run inside Instructions.txt and save changes before running the application.

These use cases are also represented as automated tests in ProBot.Tests/UseCase.cs.
